<summary>ðŸ”Ž F.A.Q</summary>

- **Q: Does this mod affect already generated End Cities?**
    - **A:** It does not. This mod only applies to the End Cities which is generated after it's installed.
#
- **Q: Does it work with mods or datapacks that changes End Cities or End Ships?**
    - **A:** Yes. It does.
#
- **Q: Does it work on Forge with Connector?**
    - **A:** Yes. It does.
#
- **Q: Can you port it above 1.21.5?**
    - **A:** No, use [Harder Elytras](https://modrinth.com/mod/harder-elytras) instead. This mod is not a replacement, it's my interpretation of it for older versions.

### Credits:

This mod was inspired by the [Harder Elytras](https://modrinth.com/mod/harder-elytras) mod, since only datapack version of it supported 1.20.1 and it was very destructive, I decided to make my own interpretation on it.

And thanks to [Cassian](https://modrinth.com/user/Cassian) for helping out on how to code this.
