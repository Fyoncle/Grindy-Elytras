# Grindy <font color="#ada9ee">Elytras</font>

A mod that replaces Elytras in the end cities with Elytra Fragment which is required for Elytra's crafting recipe that this mod adds.

This mod does <font color="#de3735">NOT</font> affect End Cities that were already generated before, it only applies to the End Cities which is generated after the mod is installed.

### Credits:

This mod was inspired by the [Harder Elytras](https://modrinth.com/mod/harder-elytras) mod, since only datapack version of it supported 1.20.1 and it was very destructive, I decided to make my own interpretation on it.
